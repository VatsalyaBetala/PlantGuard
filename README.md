## **Introduction**
Plant diseases pose a **significant threat to global food security**, causing **20-40% yield losses annually** (*FAO, 2021*). Current diagnostic methods are **slow, expensive, and require expert intervention**.  
This project offers an **AI-based, real-time, offline disease detection tool**, enabling **farmers, researchers, and agribusinesses** to:
- **Detect diseases early**, preventing crop loss.
- **Classify multiple plant diseases** with high accuracy.
- **Deploy AI models on IoT devices** like **Raspberry Pi** for offline use.

## **Installation**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VatsalyaBetala/plant-disease-classification.git
cd plant-disease-classification
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Python >= 3.8, on Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Dataset**
This project uses the **PlantVillage dataset**, which contains **thousands of labeled images** of healthy and diseased plant leaves.  
- Download the dataset from [PlantVillage](https://www.plantvillage.org/).
- Place it in the `PlantVillage/` directory within the project.

---

## **Usage**
### **Training the Model**
To train the model, run:
```bash
python train.py
```
This will:
- Load the dataset.
- Train a **ResNet-50-based deep learning model**.
- Save the trained model in the `models/` directory.

### **Evaluating the Model**
To test the model‚Äôs accuracy on the validation set:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
This will output:
- Model accuracy
- Validation loss
- Confusion matrix (optional)

---

## **Model Architecture**
The model is built using **Transfer Learning with ResNet-50**, which provides:
- **Pretrained feature extraction** from **millions of images**.
- **Fine-tuned classification layers** for detecting **plant diseases**.
- **High inference efficiency** for deployment on **low-power edge devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano).**

---

## **Results**
Our model achieves:
- **87%+ accuracy** in classifying multiple plant diseases.
- **Fast inference speed (~50ms per image)** on a **GPU**.
- **Optimized for edge deployment** with **model quantization**.

---

## **Web Interface**
PlantGuard comes with a lightweight web UI built with **FastAPI** and **Materialize CSS**. Features include:
- Image uploads with live previews and progress indicator.
- A gallery view with on-demand AI explanations and image download option.
- Dark mode support with persistent preference.
- Informative **About** and **Contact** pages.

---

## **Deployment**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Running Inference Locally**
Use `predict.py` to classify a single image:
```bash
python predict.py --image test.jpg --model models/plant_disease_model.pth
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploying on Raspberry Pi**
To run inference on **Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano**:
```bash
python deploy.py --device edge
```
**Optimizations:**
- Model **quantization** reduces size by **50%**.
- TensorFlow Lite conversion for **low-power devices**.
